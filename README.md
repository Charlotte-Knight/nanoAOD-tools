# nanoAOD Reweighting

This repository, together with [EFT2Obs](https://github.com/ajgilbert/EFT2Obs), should provide all the tools one needs to reweight nanoAOD MC samples **after** their production. The underlying principles of the tool are described [here](READMEs/underlying_principles.md) and several guides have been written:

1. [Initial setup](READMEs/initial_setup.md)
2. [Example walk through - Going from a MadGraph process line to reweighted NanoAOD](READMEs/walkthrough.md)
3. [Making adjustments for your process](READMEs/making_adjustments.md)
4. [Deriving STXS scaling functions](READMEs/scaling_functions.md)
5. [Performing your own validation](READMEs/validation.md)
6. [Event ID skimming](READMEs/event_id_skimming.md)
7. [Plotting reweighted distruibutions (checking fit variables)](READMEs/shape_plots.md)
8. [Job Submission](READMEs/job_submission.md)

If there are remaining questions or bug finds please contact charlotte.knight@cern.ch.
